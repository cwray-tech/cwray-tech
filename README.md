# Chris Wray

I’m a software engineer at a health and wellness startup called The St. James. I work primarily on our API, which serves four different frontends, and I also contribute to our web frontends.

I really enjoy building products that make people’s work easier. One project I had the privilege of spearheading and building is a nursery management application for my family’s farm. The app integrates with QuickBooks Desktop and manages nearly every aspect of the nursery—including inventory, sales, and customers. I continue to develop and support this app part-time.

I’m also working on a side project called [ClubKey](https://clubkey.site), a loyalty and rewards app for cafes and restaurants.

Outside of work, I’m blessed with a wonderful family. I’m married to my amazing wife, Areli, who is an incredible mom to our four children.

Above all, I’ve been deeply blessed by God’s grace in many ways: first, in being saved by Christ’s work; second, in being given an amazing family; and third, in experiencing healing and restoration in my body after several health struggles.
