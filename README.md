# Chris Wray

I'm a software engineer for a health and wellness startup called [The St James](https://www.thestjames.com/). I work on our API that serves 4 different frontends, and I get to work on our web frontends as well. Our tech stack is Laravel (PHP), MariaDB, and Redis on the backend. On the Frontend we use NuxtJS and Vue 3 with TypeScript. All my work for The St James is tracked in BitBucket.

I really enjoy building products that help people with their work. One project I've had the pleasure of spearheading and building is a nursery management application for my families farm. This app integrates with QuickBooks Desktop, and their entire nursery is managed through the app- like inventory, sales, customers, ect. I still work on this part time.

I'm also working on a side project called ClubKey. It's a loyalty and rewards app for cafes and restaurants.

I'm married and love my wife Areli. She is an amazing mom of our four children.

Over the years I've been blessed by God's grace in many ways. One, saved by Christ's work. Two, given an amazing family. Three, gone through multiple health struggles and have experienced restoration and healing in my physical body.
