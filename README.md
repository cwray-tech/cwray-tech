- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m learning Software Development. I am enrolled in Western Governors University and I start their program in August, 2020.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on just about everything. I love to work with others and learn from your experiences, as well as input where I can. Feel free to reach out if you are interested!
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with just about everything. I would love your input on my Github, projects and anything else you would like.

- âš¡ Fun fact: I live in Mexico most of the time. My wife was denied entry into the US after we got married, so I started my web development company to provide for us while we are waiting for her Green Card.
