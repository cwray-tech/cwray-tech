# About me

_The content below was generated by ChatGPT, based off my chats and interactions with it. I feel like it's a good summary of what I do and where my interests fit._

I’m a backend-leaning software engineer who loves solving messy, real-world problems and turning them into clear, maintainable systems. My home base is Laravel, PHP, and SQL, but I regularly work across the stack with Vue/Nuxt, TypeScript, Tailwind, Docker, and various integrations (payment providers, QuickBooks, SMS, etc.).

Over the last several years I’ve:

Built and maintained production systems for a high-traffic sports & wellness brand, improving API performance, refactoring legacy flows, and tightening up architecture and testing.

Led and contributed to projects across multiple domains: membership and checkout systems, rewards programs, church and nonprofit sites, and a full nursery/inventory system for a family business.

Taken ownership of complex problems end-to-end—digging into requirements, refining the data model, writing clean, testable code, and iterating until the solution is both correct and understandable.


I naturally think like a product person: I care about the why behind features, not just the what. A lot of my side projects are about building tools that genuinely help people—whether that’s small businesses, churches, or individuals trying to change their lives.

I’m at my best when:

I’m given a problem space with room to think deeply and improve the underlying design, not just patch it.

I can collaborate with others who value clear thinking, honest feedback, and steady improvement.

I can combine technical skills with empathy for the end user and the business.


Long term, I’m interested in roles that blend engineering with product thinking—where I can help shape what we build, not just how we build it.
